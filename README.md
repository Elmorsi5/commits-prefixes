# Commit Prefixes
## why using conventioal commits messages is important?
- It give you the information about what and why without diving into the code.
- it enable us to use the automated tools for building the releases notes for our repository.
- Improve collaboration among the team as all are following the same conventioal.

### Do you ask yourself how can you make a clear and meaningful git commits messages?<br>
Let me support you with My personal style guide for writing git commit messages using prefixes based on [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples). Prefixes should be written in the following format:

```html
<<prefix>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Scopes and BREAKING CHANGE
- Using ! after the prefix means : it's a Breaking Change
- You can also provide an explaination in the commit message as exampe:
